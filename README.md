# Module 3 | Project: L'Alc么ve

## Introduction
Module 3 is focused on learning the Frontend Framework - ReactJS.</br>
Project 3 aim is to create and present a full stack MERN Single Page Application having users and all CRUD functions and being deployed to Heroku.</br>

For this we used the following technologies which we had acquired during Module 2 & 3: 
- Node.js (especially Express.js),
- MongoDB & Mongoose, 
- Axios,
- ReactJS.

## Pitch:

"L'Alc么ve" is an existing salon dedicated to the beauty of your eyes and your nails.</br>
It's also (and especially) Mathilde's former employer and now friend.</br>
The current version of "L'Alc么ve's" website  does not have an E-commerce module and becomes slowy outdated.</br>

As it is part of "L'Alc么ve's" business strategy, we took the challenge to create an e-commerce web application.
